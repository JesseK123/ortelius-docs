If you would like to contribute code, documentation content, blogs or graphics you will need to complete the [Linux Foundation Ortelius Individual Easy Contributor License Agreement](https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/easycla/contributors/individual-contributor)

### Learn the Community Expectations and Roles

Ortelius is a community project. Consequently, it is wholly dependent on its community to provide a productive, friendly and collaborative environment.  Our contributors fit into 3 basic categories: Casual, Regular and Core.

**User Contributors:** Adopting Ortelius, finding bugs, opening tickets, helping others, creating blogs, and providing feedback are the main tasks of User Contributors. Users Contributors are the heartbeat of the Ortelius Community.  Your involvement at this level drives the Ortelius road map.

**Member Contributors:**
Working on support tickets is one of the main jobs of the Member Contributor. Member Contributors want to contribute further to the project and will assign themselves support tickets and begin to review pull request. In addition, sharing use cases, providing feedback for potential feature enhancements, and social networking about Ortelius are a few ways the Member Contributor can participate.  Member Contributors are an important group of individuals as they are the most influential group of contributors. Member Contributors should plan on attending the General Community Meetings monthly to keep up to date with the progress of Ortelius.

**Reviewer Contributors:**
Reviewing the Member Contributor pull request, attending meetings on a monthly to bi-monthly basis, stepping up to help with working group tasks, and fixing issues best describe the activities that can qualify you as Reviewer Contributor. Reviewer Contributors complete a large part of the work that needs to be done to keep the Ortelius project relevant to the broader IT community. Your participation at this level is key to the success of the project.

**Approvers Contributors:**
Approvers Contributors are individuals that have developed a level of expertise and provide a final approval of pull request.  In addition they develop product enhancements, create documentation, develope on-line videos and tutorial content.

**Chairs:**
Providing additional project management support, distribute issues to beginners, manage meetings and recordings are the jobs performed by the Chairs. Chairs need to attend most meetings and help new Contributors be successful.

You are encouraged to participate at all levels. You can move up the ladder as your personal time allows.
