### What is Ortelius?

The Ortelius Continuous Security Intelligence solution is an open-source project focused on surveilling the DevOps pipeline collecting clues and forensics about the software you deliver to end users from Software Bills of Materials (SBOM) to deployment metadata.

The mission of the Ortelius community is to expose weak links in the software supply chain by continuously gathering and analyzing software supply chain intelligence introduced across the DevOps pipeline. Generating security insights like SBOMs is not enough to harden your software supply chain. Consumption and analysis of the data is needed to rapidly respond to supply chain threats.

Ortelius is managed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation) a specialty foundation under the Linux Foundation.

## What is in this Guide?

This guide will help you understand the overall organization of the  Ortelius project, and help you get started as a contributor. And anyone can contribute. You don't have to be a 'coder.'  Your expertise in technical writing, outreach, project management and marketing are also needed.  And if you do want to code, this guide will help you find issues, write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and merged.

## Where did the Name Ortelius Come from?

Abraham Ortelius made his name by collecting data from scientists, geographers, and cartographers of his time and transforming it into what the world now knows as a world Atlas. His Atlas, titled _Theatrum Orbis Terrarum_ (Theatre of the World), was published on May 20, 1570. His Atlas disrupted the way the world was seen, with the first concepts imagining continental drift. Also of interest are the sea monsters shown in the water – mythical creatures that were a subject of fascination in Ortelius’ generation.

Ortelius also in some ways created on open source community of his day. To accomplish his goal, he was the first cartographers to give credit to his fellow scientists by adding their names to the Atlas. Ortelius was known to have corresponded with other professionals throughout Europe and pulled together their knowledge to create his publication and a truly global view of the world.

Thank you Abraham Ortelius for showing us the way.
